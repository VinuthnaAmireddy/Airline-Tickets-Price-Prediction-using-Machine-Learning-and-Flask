# Airline-Tickets-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Flask
Airline ticket prices can be somewhat hard to guess, as airline prices fluctuate constantly. So purchasing at different times could mean large differences in price.This project uses the machine learning regression methods to predict the prices at the given time and use Flask to create a web interface.
